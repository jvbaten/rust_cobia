# Rust binding for COBIA

(C) Jasper, AmsterCHEM 2025

This workspace implements rust bindings for COBIA.

CAPE-OPEN consists of a series of specifications to expand the range of application of process simulation technologies. 
The CAPE-OPEN specifications specify a set of software interfaces that allow plug and play inter-operability between
a given process modelling environment (PME) and a third-party process modelling component (PMC).

The CAPE-OPEN specifications are supported by the non-profit organization CO-LaN: http://www.colan.org

The COBIA middle-ware is a platform independent object model and request broker implementation to
facilitate the inter-operation of CAPE-OPEN compliant PMEs and PMCs.

This workspace provides:
* the `cobia` crate, a rust language binding for CO-LaNâ€™s COBIA middleware
* the `salt_water` crate, a CAPE-OPEN Property Package PMC example, for water with NaCl
* the `distillation_shortcut_unit` crate, a CAPE-OPEN Unit Operation PMC
